        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        <p>
            First create an account by clicking the register button above in the top right corner of this page. Once you have an account created you should see 'Characters' option in the navbar - click that. You then will see a webpage that is a list of any saved characters you have.
        </p>
        <p>
            If this is your first time you should see an empty list - click on 'create'. This will take you to a webpage where you can create your character. Enter your characters information and then submit it. Your character should now be saved to the database.
